# Speedometer

An in development Node.js module that returns the average speed from an array of data from an accelerometer

Currently developed to integrate with [expo-sensors](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sensors/) on a expo based mobile application and ~should~ will be expanded to work smoothly with [react-native-sensors](https://react-native-sensors.github.io/) too, but should work with any accelerometer data.


## Installation 
```sh
npm install speedometer --save
yarn add speedometer
```

## Usage

### With expo-sensors
Check the [demo expo app](https://github.com/chicomcastro/expo-speedometer)
